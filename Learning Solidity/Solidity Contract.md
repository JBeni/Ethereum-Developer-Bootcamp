Structure of a Solidity Contract

- "class" like structure
- contains functions
- controll structures IF/ELSE
- Loops For/while
- DataTypes (U)int, Boolean, Array, Struct, Mapping, Address, No Floats!
- Inheritable
- Special structures like "modifiers"
- Imports
- pragma to allow contract working for a particular version for the contract to not brake when a new version of solidity appear

Solidity version 0.8 will take care automatically about overflows and underflows (uint8 problem with 255 and 0, decrement and increment)
